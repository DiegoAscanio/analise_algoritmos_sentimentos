That's pretty much what I was trying to say. I would have guessed that they were the only ones that they could have.
Hi there
No problem. I hope you're okay with that.
Hmmm with What?
Read the manga. It's more of an order of magnitude more important than any other.
What is this article about ?
I'm sorry that you can't be bothered to read what I said.
Bad robot
I don't know what you're trying to say.
You don't answer my question
Then why are you here?
To test you
I don't think you understand what I mean.
What is the article about?
What I am trying to say is that you have no idea what it means.
I know it's about Jehovah's witnesses
What does that have to do with anything?
Well it's the MAIN thing the article talks about
Not really. It's *always* true.
