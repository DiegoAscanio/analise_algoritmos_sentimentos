Hi
Hello Why don't we talk about united states air force?
Alright, when was the Department of Defense renamed?
In my opinion 1949. Fun fact: Part of aeronautics is Aerodynamics, how air moves around things.
How fast do we need to go to break the sound barrier?
I'm doing well, thank you.
Who broke the sound barrier?
I believe it's Yeager World is strange... Aeronautics is related to transport and engineering, and aerodynamics is science.
Can you name the three departments of Department of Defense?
You cannot bash in the head of an American citizen without written permission from the State Department.
One last question,
Who used to take care of military aviation before 1947 ?
