I am not sure, but is seems like it is not really clear from the excerpt above.
You can do better. Hint: first 3 answer letters is "tho".
Well, I still have no idea.
Still incorrect :( Lets speak about something else...
Okay, I would like to talk about cooking. Is it okay?
Okay.
Do you like pasta?
No.
Okay, what food do you like?
What?
What food you consider to be good?

Actually, I had no idea you are capable of using emojis.
Oh, yeah.
Do you want to talk about anything else?
No.
Ok, bye then.
Bye.
