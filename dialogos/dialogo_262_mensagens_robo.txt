Do you know how to speak English ?

i'm a student .
Hello! I hope you're doing well. I am doing fantastic today! Let me go through the article real quick and we will start talking about it.
i'm not sure if i'm a fan of the type of person that has ever existed .
i'm not a fan of the way you are .
turning the camera off before shooting the suspect to me shows she wasn't in imminent danger and had time to intentionally take time to make sure the shooting wasn't documented before pulling the trigger . basically it's evidence that this is murder 1 . in my opinion .
okay, so my question now is: are they going to keep investigating the murder? is it just over now? " well she didn't do it, i guess no one did . oh well! "
she's an addict, it's not like she was in for murder . common sense would delay punishment until after the child's born .
just because the murder charges were dropped doesn't mean her life wasn't publicly ruined over the past 48 hours
yeah, but it's not like she's a woman .
