Hi
Who are you?
I have no middle name
What is yours?
No, I don't think so
Tell me your middlename :)
Because I think it is useless
Okey 
So. Who are you? How can I call you?
Why? Don't you want to have a real name? Like Sarah or Paul or Kickassbot?:)
That means that you are a very cool bot
What?
whatever :)
How are you?
A bit sleepy and tired
Just a bit
Taurus
