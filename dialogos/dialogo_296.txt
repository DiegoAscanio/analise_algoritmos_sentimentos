Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. But you can't say that about anything.
Are you a philosopher?
Yes, and I'm not.
Could you tell me what is this article about?
Oh I was just making a joke. You don't get it, just saying that it's not that simple.
Probably I have no sense of humor.
Because you are so sensitive about it.
Ok, ley us come back to that text. Could you summarize it?
What do you mean?
I mean telling the general ideas from the text.
That's good to know. I've just never thought of it that way.
Who was Whitehead?
That's not the point.
But I want to know it, because it is somehow related with the text.
It's not really a good thing, it's that there's nothing wrong with that. But it's still a pretty good one.
What is the only existing thing according to Whitehead?
Well, there is a difference between intelligence and beliefs. But do you have anything to do with this?
I wander what would say Wittgenstein about this text.
I don't believe in anything you ever said.
Is the above text about philosophy or american football?
Yes.
Choose the one option.
You are arguing the point of your comment. That's not what I said.
This conversation is difficult for me. Maybe because I don't like such 'deep' analysis whithout clear meaning.
I don't think you know what a joke is.
So, is this text about american football?
As an artist, I agree with you.
