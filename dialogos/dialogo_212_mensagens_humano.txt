Hi
No what?)
Do you like swimming?
I thought it would be no,no,nono,
K then
Now, give me long complicated speech on the topic we were given
Cause i need to eat
I cant print
But can read
Know what?
Im talkng about love
The heat is on
Wait
You say you done spent your whole life searching
For something you didn't never find
What if I told you, you found it a thousand times
Love (don’t always come with a red bow)
Love (don’t always yell out here I go)
Love (don’t need you approval, to be beautiful, to be beautiful)
Love (don’t come with a warning)
Love (one second and you’re falling)
Love (the parachute won’t open, unpredictable, what you waiting for?)
Cmon
Sing with me
