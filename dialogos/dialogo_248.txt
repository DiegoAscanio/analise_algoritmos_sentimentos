That's something I've never heard of before. Thank you.
Hi! It's a not interesting article for me. Let's discuss as humans
It's a lot easier to say where there are a lot of people in this thread than it is to get a basis for what they do.
What do you mean by a basis?
Read the entire article.
I said that I'm not interesting to discuss the article about US, government.
It's not the same, it's the fact that you see the movie and that is what they do.
Where are you from? Seriously
I think you missed the point of my comment.
good bye
What was the question?
