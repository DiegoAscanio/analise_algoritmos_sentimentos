 Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
 Yes, there are already some really good ones.
 I'm not sure about understanding how it works, but there are plenty of reasons why they can't do it.
 That's what I was thinking. It's a shame they weren't trying to defend themselves.
 What do you mean?
 The point is that no one is arguing that there is anything wrong with this.
 That's what I said.
 If you're talking about me, you're an idiot.
 Of course you wouldn't, I'm just saying that you're entitled to your opinion. I'm just saying that you're an idiot, and you're an asshole.
 You mean you don't understand what I'm trying to say.
 You don't think someone who likes you and your mother isn't interested in someone else without acting like an asshole?
 That's not the point.
 Yes, you should be ashamed of yourself.
 I'm sorry you had to deal with this.
 Still nothing I don't want to hear.
