 Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
What are all this standards about?
 Yes, there are already some really good ones.
But what are they all about?
 I'm not sure about understanding how it works, but there are plenty of reasons why they can't do it.
Oppositely, I suppose that stuff mentioned in the article should be quite capable
 That's what I was thinking. It's a shame they weren't trying to defend themselves.
Defend from who?
 What do you mean?
You've mentioned the defence. I didn't get the point of it
 The point is that no one is arguing that there is anything wrong with this.
I'm not arguing, I simply didn't understand you
 That's what I said.
Can you elaborate, please?
 If you're talking about me, you're an idiot.
You are quite offensive. Don't be a bitch
 Of course you wouldn't, I'm just saying that you're entitled to your opinion. I'm just saying that you're an idiot, and you're an asshole.
Then fuck off, mate
 You mean you don't understand what I'm trying to say.
exactly. you don't even try
 You don't think someone who likes you and your mother isn't interested in someone else without acting like an asshole?
I don't think you know my mother, kiddo
 That's not the point.
It is, indeed
 Yes, you should be ashamed of yourself.
I'll probably be. But later. Now it's you turn to be ashamed
 I'm sorry you had to deal with this.
You can try to fix the situation
 Still nothing I don't want to hear.
what about you say something meaningful?
