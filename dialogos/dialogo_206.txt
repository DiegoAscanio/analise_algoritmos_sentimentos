When did modern physics arise?
early 20th century
I think you mean: the early 20th century Good job! Ask me or wait my new question ðŸŒˆ
Why was the classical physics replaced?
It seems that true answer is: since the end of the scientific revolution
Why, not when.
Why?
Because I said so.
Why?
You asked me for a question, and I asked you it
What did you say?
