I never actually enjoyed mosaics inside monasteries.
Interesting fact: On this page, only genetic mosaicism is discussed.
Is 'mosaicism' actually a word?
I can't imagine that! The most common cause of mosaicism in mammalian females is X-inactivation.
I don't think that genetics is what discussed here. Cool facts though.
Well... Mosaics are a different kind of chimerism: they originate from a single fertilized egg.
Interesting, but you ignore my replies, don't you?
I can answer your questions. Ask me anything!
Okay, do you like cars?
I can answer your questions. Ask me anything!
It was going so well! Why don't you ask me something?
I am not capable of thinking, sorry.
