No, it doesn't. It's not even close to anything.
That's not really something to be concerned with. It's one of the reasons why so many people have a different opinion than them.
How is it not impossible to understand? What does that have to do with anything?
I don't think you understand how people are interpreting it.
Oh, I get it. That's the joke.
Okay.
