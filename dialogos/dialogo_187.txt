Hi.
So you are saying that there are many people who have proven they haven't been held accountable for everything?
You are an idiot.
I didn't say anything.
Well then you're probably right about that, but I would have no problem with that.
What do you think about the paragraph?
I think it's the same without any response.
Are you good at histor
y?
Or he's referring to the difference between the two.
I think you mean "good"
Okay. It's nice talking with you.
Oh I see, sorry for the confusion.
No problem.
No problem, I wasn't trying to convince you of anything.
Bye.
You're an idiot.
