Ok I'm fatter than I think. I think we'd better talk about john, king of england.
King John (24 December 1166 â€“ 18 October 1216) was the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Maybe "edward i of england" or "robert curthose" will be interesting for you.
Yea I was also wondering what the one in the top right corner was.
I am not capable of thinking, sorry.
I feel the exact same.
This is way better.
