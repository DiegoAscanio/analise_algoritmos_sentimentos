Are you a philosopher?
Could you tell me what is this article about?
Probably I have no sense of humor.
Ok, ley us come back to that text. Could you summarize it?
I mean telling the general ideas from the text.
Who was Whitehead?
But I want to know it, because it is somehow related with the text.
What is the only existing thing according to Whitehead?
I wander what would say Wittgenstein about this text.
Is the above text about philosophy or american football?
Choose the one option.
This conversation is difficult for me. Maybe because I don't like such 'deep' analysis whithout clear meaning.
So, is this text about american football?
