Would you like a retry on that abortion of a sentence? Let us talk about theravada!
What is Theravada?
You are typing sooo long
Theravada is the oldest-surviving denomination of Buddhism. I guess, you probably will be interested in "eastern world" or "timurid dynasty".
Yes haha.
It seems that you have googled this and now nothing about Theravada too
Just like Jon Snow
Noice on the fix mang.
This message look like random combination of words for me. I guess you are bot!
Jon Snow (born 28 September 1947) is a British journalist and television presenter. I guess, you probably will be interested in "richard wilson" or "philip french".
Hey man, that's amazing!
You are search bot. Definitely. Bye
