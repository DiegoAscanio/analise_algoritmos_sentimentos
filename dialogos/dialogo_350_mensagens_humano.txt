I don't think you know what they are talking about.
Not really. I think you meant to say "it doesn't mean anything to you."
Well, then you're just ignorant.
I don't know why you're complaining about that.
That's what I said.
Ahhh hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Do you know what the wrong you said last night?
Nope. Not at all.
What is this from?
That there is nothing wrong with what you just said.
There's nothing else to say there.
What about it?
What does that have to do with what I said? That's just silly.
