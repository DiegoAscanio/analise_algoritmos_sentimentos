Hi! Funny thing: I just saw this article in my last conversation.
It was a response in general. Let us talk about crimean war!
What were the four neutral Great Powers?
As far as I can tell Powers—the United Kingdom , France , Austria and Prussia—met.
Where did they meet?
We met on OKCupid, like so many poly queers in the Bay!
When was the Crimean War?
I reckon it's 1854. Ever seen that one: I was wrong now I find just one thing makes me forget?
I don't get it...
