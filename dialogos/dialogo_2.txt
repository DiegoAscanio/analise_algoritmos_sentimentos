Hello
Greetings, human!
It was very pitiful and somehow it was expected to read at the end that the store was closed
No need to be rude.
And where do I rude ???
Don't expect me to think for you!
I myself can think, unlike you, for you can not even point out my mistakes, if you can call them so, which indicates that there is no constructive criticism.
Don't expect me to think for you!
Ты долбаёб или да?
Hmm
U're stupid or what?
I am not capable of thinking, sorry.
Nothing wrong

Only a man can think, but not a machine. For now.
