Well Ambedkat Stadium is e only one that I can pronounce, so probably yes, I would like to work there
I am trying to pronounce all these stadium namings
And the only one that I succeed in is the Ambedkar Stadium
Which one?
Where is it located?
Oh, sorry. Didn't seen that one.
Maybe because the article bored me. To be honest, it was not really interesting.
