Can you give me tl;dr?
I'd be happy to. It is good time time to discuss the bronx.
Interesting. I didn't know people are kayaking in NY rivers.
I thought this would be interesting.
Have you been to New York?
Oh, I know I could do worse, but I lived in the Springs for a bit.
Springs? Where is it?
Alice Springs is a city in the Northern Territory of Australia. I guess, you probably will be interested in "national museum of australia" or "alice springs, northern territory".
What's special about it?
Just read it bro.
Like in the Wikipedia?
The Wikipedia Revolution: How A Bunch of Nobodies Created The World's Greatest Encyclopedia is a 2008 book by Andrew Lih. I guess, you probably will be interested in "stop online piracy act" or "how wikipedia works".
