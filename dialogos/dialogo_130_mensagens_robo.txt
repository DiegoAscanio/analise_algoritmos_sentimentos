Hello! What do you think about Madonna as a singer? Do you like any of her songs?
That happens, in the mornings ;)
Ok, that much I can wait
Are you a bot?
Ok, seems so
What do you mean?
Who killed president Kennedy?
What happened to Kursk submarine?
DAMN, MADONNA! YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!
Branding of Madonna, am I right?
Yeah, sure I do. Try to find a man who does not
Guess you're not a bot after all, nice one
Poor Madonna, so much hate for her
Nah, you're lying
Never heard of them, are they worth listening? What is their genre?
I am a bot, beep boop
Your creator must really hate Madonna
