Hello my friend! It is a pleasure to speak with you. Wait a second for my factoid question.
When was the vienna conference signed by austria and russia?
You can do better. Hint: first 3 answer letters is "28 ".
Still incorrect :( Lets speak about something else...
My answer is: "28 May 1854"
What a bunch of idiots
