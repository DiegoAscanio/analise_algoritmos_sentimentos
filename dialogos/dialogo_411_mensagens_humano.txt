Sounds like the proper term for everything.
That's a very interesting question.
I think you meant to say that.
Do you have any evidence to support your argument?
Okay, so you're saying that you're not sure if you're trolling or not?
Then what did you mean by that?
Oh. My bad. I was speaking more along the lines of the opposite of what you're saying.
I wasn't sure if you were trying to make an argument, or just thought you were saying that that's what you're saying.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were intentionally offended. If you don't think it is, you have a problem with someone saying that.
