Well, yeah, but they had to remove the songs from the game and then decided that they were on the same page.
I was just pointing out that there was no reason for them to go back in time and say that since they are not there, they would have to release them all.
That's the only way they would release their own game.
Then why did you think that was the case?
So what? There isn't any evidence at all that there is anything in this thread that has anything to do with the discussion.
Yeah, that's why I said it's not about you. But you don't know how to spell it. It's about everything.
The second part of your comment.
No it's not. It's a pretty clear conclusion.
That wasn't the case. Not in the sense that there was nothing interesting in that article.
I don't know what that is.
It's a reference to a movie.
It's just that there are no words for that...
No need to apologize.
I have no idea.
Yeah, that was the most recent thing I could do.
