Hello
'What is subsequently' : Is it a question ?
How many refugees were crossing the bridge when North Korean army attacked ?
A refugee, generally speaking, is a displaced person who has been forced to cross national boundaries and who cannot return home safely
Boundaries are geographic borders of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities.
