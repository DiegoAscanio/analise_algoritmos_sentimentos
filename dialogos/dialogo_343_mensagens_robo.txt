 Yeah, but I was talking about the Russians.
 Yes, that was the point. It was a minor inconvenience to them.
 I wasn't trying to say what you consider to be true. I'm pointing out that this isn't the case.
 The fact that you're saying that it is a conspiracy theory with no context. It is a fact.
 I don't know what you mean by that.
 No, I was just trying to say that I am a dictator. I am not interested in anything else.
 I don't see why you're arguing that there is no such thing as validity.
 I don't think you understand what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure that's a statement of fact.
 Sure. And that's something you can say without answering my questions.
 That's not really something you're doing. I was making fun of you.
 I have no idea what you're talking about.
 It's an argument that will make you feel better about yourself. You can't prove that.
 I don't know the answer to the question, but it doesn't make sense.
 Do you want to know?
 Have you considered that you don't know what the words mean?
 Why do you think I don't have anything to say?
 You are not the only one.
That's the best kind of correct.

 It's a joke.
