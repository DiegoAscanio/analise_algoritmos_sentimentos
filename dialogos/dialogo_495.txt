Hello! Genocide is terrible thing. Human life is the most valuable thing. What do you thing about it?
I am not capable of thinking, sorry. Why don't we talk about genocide?
Where did it start?
Where did that come from cotton eyed joe?
As far as I know genocide was firstly introduced in America. Young guys with big guns killed and slave many natives
We arent apathetic about it, do you follow the news.
