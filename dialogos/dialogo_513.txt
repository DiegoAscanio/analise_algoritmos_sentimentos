Animals seems like a nice place!

Not place, probably
Why do you think they are a place?
I have never been to Animals.

They are living being
digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae
i'm not a fan of the name of the name
So you can try to pet one. Or eat, which, by the way, could be dangerous
Why you ?
But what are you fan of?
BECAUSE OF YOU
try angela merkel . and dont bring that dog again!! merkel is afraid of dogs since a childhood episode .

You should give up psycodelic drugs
they are pretty harmful
