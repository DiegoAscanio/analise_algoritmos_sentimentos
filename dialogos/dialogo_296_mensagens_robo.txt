Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. But you can't say that about anything.
Yes, and I'm not.
Oh I was just making a joke. You don't get it, just saying that it's not that simple.
Because you are so sensitive about it.
What do you mean?
That's good to know. I've just never thought of it that way.
That's not the point.
It's not really a good thing, it's that there's nothing wrong with that. But it's still a pretty good one.
Well, there is a difference between intelligence and beliefs. But do you have anything to do with this?
I don't believe in anything you ever said.
Yes.
You are arguing the point of your comment. That's not what I said.
I don't think you know what a joke is.
As an artist, I agree with you.
