When was the war?
 Yeah, but I was talking about the Russians.
 Yes, that was the point. It was a minor inconvenience to them.
What point?
 I wasn't trying to say what you consider to be true. I'm pointing out that this isn't the case.
What case?
 The fact that you're saying that it is a conspiracy theory with no context. It is a fact.
Why the fact?
 I don't know what you mean by that.
Do you love me?
 No, I was just trying to say that I am a dictator. I am not interested in anything else.
I am a dictator too
 I don't see why you're arguing that there is no such thing as validity.

 I don't think you understand what I'm talking about.
Yes I don't understand
I'm not sure that's a statement of fact.
But do you love me?
 Sure. And that's something you can say without answering my questions.
Nope
I wanna love
 That's not really something you're doing. I was making fun of you.
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

 I don't know the answer to the question, but it doesn't make sense.
It makes sense
 Do you want to know?
Yes I want
 Have you considered that you don't know what the words mean?
I dont know your language
 Why do you think I don't have anything to say?
Yes
exactly
 You are not the only one.
That's the best kind of correct.
Of cause
