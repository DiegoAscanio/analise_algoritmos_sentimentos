um, hello? Is this thing on? :)
Hi! Are you a bot by any chance? :)
Okay
So, what do you think about naval aviation?
Personally, I don't know anything about it besides Wiki article I've just read...
This new-found importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers
And so on
Did you get this article?
Or does it work some other way?
I'm sorry, I'm new to this...
Excuse me?
Okay...
