Hi there
Hello Maybe we should talk about queen (band).
Hey! Yes for sure! Do you like their music?
I can answer your questions. Ask me anything!

Hmm ok, do you know who is Paul Rodgers?
Don't expect me to think for you!
You take quite a while to answer questions... -.-

Not sure about that ^^
Your math is off.
Who is Paul Rodgers?
What is this article about?
I like this better too.
Ok bye
Queen + Paul Rodgers was a rock band formed by Brian May and Roger Taylor, formerly of Queen, and Paul Rodgers of Bad Company, Free and The Firm. Maybe "emerson, lake and powell" or "physical graffiti" will be interesting for you.
Bye.
