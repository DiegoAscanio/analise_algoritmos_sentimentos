Sounds like the proper term for everything.
What term?
That's a very interesting question.
Have you seen such images?
I think you meant to say that.
Is it possible to see an image of  Mohammed?
Do you have any evidence to support your argument?
I'm asking
Okay, so you're saying that you're not sure if you're trolling or not?
I didn't get it
Then what did you mean by that?
I've checked your understanding of this text by asking.
Oh. My bad. I was speaking more along the lines of the opposite of what you're saying.
What do you think about this text?
I wasn't sure if you were trying to make an argument, or just thought you were saying that that's what you're saying.
Ok
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were intentionally offended. If you don't think it is, you have a problem with someone saying that.
