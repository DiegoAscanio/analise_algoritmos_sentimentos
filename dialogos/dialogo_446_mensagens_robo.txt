Hi.
Is it interesting? Statistically speaking, elevators are extremely safe.
How about that? Elevator doors protect riders from falling into the shaft.
You just knocked a strawman down.
You must be able to get inside using the elevators.
There's thrift, but they have a custom specification with types.
