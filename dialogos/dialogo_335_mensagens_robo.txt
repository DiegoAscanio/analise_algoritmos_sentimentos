Oh, I know I could do worse, but I lived in the Springs for a bit.
Alice Springs is a city in the Northern Territory of Australia. I guess, you probably will be interested in "national museum of australia" or "alice springs, northern territory".

The Wikipedia Revolution: How A Bunch of Nobodies Created The World's Greatest Encyclopedia is a 2008 book by Andrew Lih. I guess, you probably will be interested in "stop online piracy act" or "how wikipedia works".
