 Thanks for the clarification.
Not very interesting
 There are no such things as terrorists.
Why there should be?
 Because there is no consequence of it being the problem. What is the point of using the word "conspiracy" to make you think it is?
And here it is?
 Yes.
I can't see.
 I think you missed the point of this thread.
May be you are right. But I suppose that terrorism is a very small part of Muslim culture.
 I agree. I don't even think it's relevant to the thread that this thread has ever happened to.
Why you decided to discuss terrorists? You could have emphasized on something else.
 That's not what I said, but that doesn't make it true.
And what you said?
 That's not how it works. If you don't believe in anything, it's still delusional.
