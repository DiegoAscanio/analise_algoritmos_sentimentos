We don't know what is the Book 6 about.
I mean that it is difficult to guess what is the book we are reading about.
Who was the author of Aeneid?
What is depicted on a shield?
I am not sarcastic at all.
It is in the text, I guess.
Is it a Roman history?
Who was King Evander?
Are you sure?
Is Evander still alive?
Kind of.
How many books does Aeneid have?
Could you tell me how many books does Aeneid have?
