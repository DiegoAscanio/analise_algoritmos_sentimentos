What is a respirator?
A respirator is a kind of mask that is used to protect someone from breathing in dusts, fumes, or gases that might hurt them. Maybe "cabinet (furniture)" or belaying will be interesting for you. I think we'd better talk about the blitz.
That was impressive!
Thank you
I don't get it.
Let's talk about the blitz
You are welcome!
Talk about yourself.
I'm female, 26 years old, from Saint-Petersburg
I am a linguist
I forgot I was in worldnews and not science.
You seem to be a real person
This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist.
A pleasure to meet you
Well you got one thing right, he was as real as any of us.
I am not a sir, though
You are too kind.
Now it's your turn
Tell me about yourself
Well, kinda.
Well, I'm glad you've found a way to make it work for you.
No, software will live forever.
What would you like to discuss next?
It's one of those things that I enjoy as a classic trope.
Do go on
You have read the post you linked right?
About the WVS?
There is something different about you.
I'm not a bot :)
Every account on reddit is a bot except you.
