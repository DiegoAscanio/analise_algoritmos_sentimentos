Hello!
Hi.
Dy you prefer elevators of ladders?
Is it interesting? Statistically speaking, elevators are extremely safe.
I just need some point to start our dialog without reading an article above)
How about that? Elevator doors protect riders from falling into the shaft.
Sounds logical...
I hate elevators without internal doors
You just knocked a strawman down.
I mean, when it moves there is notghin between you and wall
You must be able to get inside using the elevators.
There's thrift, but they have a custom specification with types.
yep.. so, it was an interisting talk about elevators. thank you!
