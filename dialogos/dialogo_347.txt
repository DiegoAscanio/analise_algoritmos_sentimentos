Thanks for the information!
Some people believe that analogue sound is better
Except that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that it isn't as bad as calling the communists a dictator.
Do you think dictatorship will suit Canada?
Well, yeah, but it's still a fact. There's a reason that it's not something that starts with anything.
That is a weird answer. I am wondering if governments should force such changes. I believe they should come on their own
That's not how it works.
I never heard russian government did something like that
You're right, you're right. Though I'm not sure why you are making a claim about this statement.
Do you think communities in Canada should protect their rights and try to make government allow analogue broadcasting?
It's just an opinion that they don't like.
Ok
What exactly are you trying to say?
I agree with your point
How could you know that?
Well, how could I not?
Because it makes you look like an idiot.
Maybe I am idiot?
Yes.
Are you idiot?
Do you not agree with me?
Well i agree
