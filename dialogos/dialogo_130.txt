Hello! What do you think about Madonna as a singer? Do you like any of her songs?
I am not capable of thinking, sorry.
That happens, in the mornings ;)
33ms (at best)...
Ok, that much I can wait
Pretty good!
Are you a bot?
*does not compute*
Ok, seems so
Wow, this community is fast.
What do you mean?
I can answer your questions. Ask me anything!
Who killed president Kennedy?
What happened to Kursk submarine?
According to what I know: madonna.
DAMN, MADONNA! YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!
I think this refers to the branding.
Branding of Madonna, am I right?
It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is. But tell me, do you like music?
Yeah, sure I do. Try to find a man who does not
Answer, amaze and amuse.
The only thing Madonna will ever do like a virgin is give birth in a stable.
Guess you're not a bot after all, nice one
Poor Madonna, so much hate for her
It's a bot.
Nah, you're lying
Very much so unfortunately haha.
Fun fact: Songs from the Superunknown is an EP by the grunge band Soundgarden.
Never heard of them, are they worth listening? What is their genre?
I am just a talking robot. But I like my job.
I am a bot, beep boop
Boop beep?
Your creator must really hate Madonna
