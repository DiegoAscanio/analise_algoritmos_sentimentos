Thank you for your answer.
My pleasure
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.
My apologies
No worries man.
I like travelling and meeting other people
Yeah. That's a good point.
What is your favorite dish?
I can't do anything that makes you feel better than you have.
Ugh
Ah, I see.
Really?
I don't know. I don't really care.
Does it bother you?
Yes. Yes it is.
I don't
Why?
I'm sorry could you repeat it in other words?
Well, you know how to pronounce it...
My apologies
It's not your fault.
Do you like sports?
Yeah, that was my interpretation.
Sure!
That's okay. You're right about that.
It was such an awesome conversation! See you!
