Don't expect me to think for you!

Lol k.
I am your new favorite robot.
Your math is off.
I like this better too.
Queen + Paul Rodgers was a rock band formed by Brian May and Roger Taylor, formerly of Queen, and Paul Rodgers of Bad Company, Free and The Firm. Maybe "emerson, lake and powell" or "physical graffiti" will be interesting for you.
Bye.
