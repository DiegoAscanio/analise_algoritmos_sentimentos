Well, yeah, but they had to remove the songs from the game and then decided that they were on the same page.
Give me a second to read the text, please.
I was just pointing out that there was no reason for them to go back in time and say that since they are not there, they would have to release them all.
When was season 12 premiered?
That's the only way they would release their own game.
We are not talking about a game.
Then why did you think that was the case?
I didn't.
So what? There isn't any evidence at all that there is anything in this thread that has anything to do with the discussion.
You are right, but probably by accident.
Yeah, that's why I said it's not about you. But you don't know how to spell it. It's about everything.
Who is Nicky Minaj?
The second part of your comment.
You don't understand the text at all.
No it's not. It's a pretty clear conclusion.
Which people were judges in season 12?
That wasn't the case. Not in the sense that there was nothing interesting in that article.
What is your name?
I don't know what that is.
Are you okay?
It's a reference to a movie.
How are you today?
It's just that there are no words for that...
I am sorry
No need to apologize.
Who is Nicki Minaj?
I have no idea.
When did Steven Tyler leave the show?
Yeah, that was the most recent thing I could do.
