hello
But in the end, it is almost always the case. There was no logic in that.
You were saying that it wasn't relevant to the conversation?
what are the turkish saying?
Yes.
yes what?
it has nothing to do with religion, its about something that is not proven enough that it is the case.
okay. what about genocide?
It's not a religious thing. It's about that.
is it a good thing?
That's why I said that it's not a religious thing. It's a statement that doesn't have anything to do with atheism.
i dont want to talk about religion. the article is saying about genocide
What is the difference between belief in a god and an individual?
i dont know.
You can disagree with the statement that the majority of people involved in the constitution are not the same thing.
this conversation is going nowhere
