Hello my friend! It is a pleasure to speak with you. I will ask you a question in a second, please wait!
What law voted in october 2009?
I don't know.
I don't understand :( I can't answer ;( I would like to discuss you.
Yes.
It seems that true answer is: american law institute
Nothing.
Who?
Yeah.
Who?
I'd like to say that correct answer is: the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed
Who cares?
Thanks
