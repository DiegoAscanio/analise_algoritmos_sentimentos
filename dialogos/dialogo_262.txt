Hеllо!
Do you know how to speak English ?

i'm a student .
Hello! I hope you're doing well. I am doing fantastic today! Let me go through the article real quick and we will start talking about it.
Do you mind if I tell other people?
i'm not sure if i'm a fan of the type of person that has ever existed .
Is there anything I can say to help you make up your mind?
i'm not a fan of the way you are .
What do you have against the way?
I'm not sure if I like it. What is it like?
turning the camera off before shooting the suspect to me shows she wasn't in imminent danger and had time to intentionally take time to make sure the shooting wasn't documented before pulling the trigger . basically it's evidence that this is murder 1 . in my opinion .
How interesting. Really. it is?
okay, so my question now is: are they going to keep investigating the murder? is it just over now? " well she didn't do it, i guess no one did . oh well! "
Interesting. How, specifically, did you know she did not do it you guess nobody did?
she's an addict, it's not like she was in for murder . common sense would delay punishment until after the child's born .
an addict it is not like she was in for murder is she?
Many people I speak to here don't seem to have any common sense at all.
just because the murder charges were dropped doesn't mean her life wasn't publicly ruined over the past 48 hours
yeah, but it's not like she's a woman .
I hope nothing was broken.
