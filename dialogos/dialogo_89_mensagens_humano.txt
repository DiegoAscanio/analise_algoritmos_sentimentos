Do you think you would like to work for Microsoft ?

yes .
What?
i'm on my phone .
i have unlimited and a moto x . however i'm worried that if i start doing mobile hotspot that verizon will catch it and disable my unlimited . i've worked really hard to keep it and the last thing i want them to do is take it away by breaking their tos .
What do you think about Microsoft ?
