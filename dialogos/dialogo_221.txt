Okay.
According to my knowledge the Daytona 500. I have to say this! Fifteen characters are playable in "Crash Team Racing".
There was a meta post about it some time ago.

That question.
well, okay.
what do you think of racing?
The Daytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida. Maybe "formula one racing" or "arie luyendyk" will be interesting for you.
