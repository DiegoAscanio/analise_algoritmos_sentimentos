Nice! I also have an older one that works with a collection of different prices on the rest of my collection. If you're interested in trading, I'd be interested in that.
What are you looking for?
That would be great. I would definitely do it for the PS3 :)
I would love to buy it but I'm not so much interested in doing it. I wouldn't mind selling it if you don't want to play.
