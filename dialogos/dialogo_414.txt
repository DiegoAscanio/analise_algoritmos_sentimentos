 I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but what I meant is that if you're putting words in my mouth, I don't see why you wouldn't want to go through that.
 It isn't. It's the problem. It's just that when you have to deal with shit, you lose a lot of people.
You should be more polite.
 Does it?
Cut it out.
 You're just being a dick.
Shut up.
 I'm not trolling, that's just my opinion.
