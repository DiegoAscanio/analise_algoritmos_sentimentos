Hi there
Hello Why don't we talk about list of numbered streets in manhattan?
Sure... did you know what the article is saying? I never paid attention to this but I will to see if it's true where I live
Two vultures boarded a plane, each carrying two dead raccoons. the  stewardess stops them and says "sorry sir, only one carrion per  passenger." 
Lol?
Ohhh yeah!
So, do you have numbered streets where you live?

So I guess it's a yes..?
Nope.
